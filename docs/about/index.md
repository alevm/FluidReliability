# About

## The Framework

Fluid Reliability emerged through necessity, iteration, and lived experience—not theoretical design. What began in a 4-person team grew into a proven model applied across three major organizational shifts.

This documentation represents applied organizational research distilling six years of practice into a framework grounded in sociology, systems thinking, and technical enablement.
