# About

## The Framework

**Fluid Reliability** was never designed as a one-time transformation project. It emerged through necessity, iteration, and lived experience of operating within volatility—technical, organizational, and human. What began in the standalone Construct (e-Builder) team grew into a proven, repeatable model applied across three major organizational shifts, consistently delivering stability, resilience, clarity, and morale.

This documentation represents applied organizational research distilling six years of practice into a framework grounded in sociology, systems thinking, and technical enablement. The methodology evolved alongside its environment, with outcomes validated through embedded reality rather than theoretical models.

## Market Positioning

| Approach | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| Google SRE | Complementary |
| Team Topologies | Complementary |
| Platform Engineering alone | Alternative (cultural change required) |

## The Author

**Andrea Valenti** leads SRE at the organization, managing 38 engineers across a multi-billion dollar platform. The Fluid Reliability framework documented here emerged from six years of applied research during three major organizational mergers.

## The Conclusion

> *"Companies that change may survive, but companies that transform thrive."*

The Fluid Reliability framework demonstrates that organizational transformation requires systematic attention to human systems design.

Organizations that cannot metabolize adversity cannot sustain reliability.

**This is the shape of the water:** not a fixed form, but a continuous adaptation to every container it encounters.
