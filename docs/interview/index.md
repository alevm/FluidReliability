## Key Topics Discussed

### On Organizational Transformation
> *"They become some sort of irrelevant to an extent because we get so used to change."*

The framework treats change as the natural state, not an exception to be managed.

### On Personnel Rotation
> *"Every share the pain is a key factor in a team. We all have to share that amount of pain."*

Rotation isn't just about knowledge transfer—it's about building empathy and shared understanding across the organization.

### On Continuous Improvement
> *"We are obsessed for the habit of not looking at what is something... there is all the time a reason to have a conversation on our process."*

Double-loop learning means constantly questioning not just outcomes, but the norms that produce them.

### On Value vs. Activity
> *"I washed those clothes. Not 10 clothes, I don't know, washed 10 socks. I don't care, I don't need them."*

The framework focuses on outcomes that matter, not activity metrics.
